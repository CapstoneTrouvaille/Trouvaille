# Trouvaille 	:airplane:
### *Plan. Travel. Reminisce.*
Trouvaille, *pronounced trouÂ·vay*, is a collaborative mobile application used to plan group trips and save group trip memories.

A trip coordinator creates a new trip by specifying a trip name, location and trip start and end dates.  After the trip is created, the coordinator can invite trip members to collaborate with.  Once a trip member accepts the trip invitation, they can use the explore feature to search for activities, restaurants and local attractions and add items to each day of the trip itinerary. Any activity that is saved or added to the itinerary is visibile to all trip members. Members can use chat to communicate and finalize plans and off everyone goes!

Once the trip is in progress, trip members can save **Memories** including journal entries, photos, and voice recordings. No more clumsy group texts or failed messages. Saving items in Trouvaille allows all trip members to easily access trip memories in one central location meaning more fun and less stress! .:people_hugging: :camera_flash: :writing_hand:
